## Idea and developement of the project

The idea of this project is to show my JavaScript Dom manipulation. Along with the project development I got inspiration from very different sources, including blogs, YouTube, MDA, StackOverflow, and W3Schools.

To overcome the challenge, I first started by thinking in a way to create the menu from the JS code, after developing the ideal in which I could generate the HTML code necessary based in the number of sections, I got into the part where I needed to link the menu items to its section, using my skills of research and asking questions, I found different ways to achieve this goal, choosing the one that I found to be the most elegant and simple to understand.
To create the scroll animation I used the tips I could find on YouTube, and StackOverflow, figuring out the best way that could work on my project. With this new successful accomplishment I start to figure out a way to highlight the section that I was scrolling over so that it could have the appropriate class from the CSS. After completing the project requirements, I also played if other functionalities that I found interesting to the website.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality
